# ECG-Signal-Visualizer
This MATLAB project visualizes ECG signals in a clear and interactive way. It allows users to load ECG data, display the waveform in the time domain, and apply basic filtering techniques to remove noise. This tool is designed for biomedical signal analysis and educational purposes.
## Features
- Load ECG data from `.mat` or `.csv` files.
- Display ECG signals in the **time domain**.
- Apply **basic filtering** for noise removal.
- Detect **R-peaks** and calculate **heart rate** (bonus feature).
- Simple, user-friendly interface.

## How to Run
1. Open `ecg_signal_visualizer.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script.
3. Use the GUI or console options to:
   - **Load ECG data**.
   - **Visualize the waveform**.
   - **Apply filters** to remove baseline drift or noise.
   - (Optional) Detect R-peaks.

## Tech Used
- **MATLAB** (Signal visualization and processing)
- Signal Processing Toolbox (if filtering is applied)


## Why This Project?
This project demonstrates:
1. Biomedical signal handling (ECG) in MATLAB.
2. Application of filtering and basic analysis techniques.
3. Ability to design a clean, functional visualization tool.
